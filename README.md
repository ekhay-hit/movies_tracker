## Description

This application allow you to search movies using Popcorn API, and it provide you option to add movies that you watched. You can only add a movie after you rated it. It allows you also remove movied from the list watched movies. It uses local storage to store the movies.
In this project I implement useEffect, useState, useRef and customs hooks for practice. This project is base on a class I was taking in Udemy to learn react.
